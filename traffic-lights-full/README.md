# Traffic Lights full

## Variations

- [Traffic Lights](traffic-lights.md) - traffic lights, button and buzzer - can be used with a breadboard or with the Traffic HAT

## Preparation

Hardware options:

- Traffic HAT
- pi-stop directly on GPIO pins, button and buzzer on a breadboard
- All components on a breadboard (could use camjam kit)

- If using a breadboard, wire up the components to the following pins:
    - Green: GPIO22
    - Yellow: GPIO23
    - Red: GPIO24
    - Button: GPIO25
    - Buzzer: GPIO5
- If using a Traffic HAT, place this on the Pi before starting

## Notes

- Be careful with capitalisation in Python!
- Check the correct pin numbers are used
- Use a port label if you have one available:
    - Buy one from http://rasp.io/portsplus/
    - Print your own from https://github.com/splitbrain/rpibplusleaf
